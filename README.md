# Camel Case Ghp Repo Name

Used to demonstrate that https://github.com/elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action doesn't
work well out of the box with users/organizations/repos that are capitalized.

Also used to show a workaround.

This repo builds a Dockerfile that's just 'hello-world' and pushes to its GitHub Packages instance.

Issue: https://github.com/elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action/issues/63
